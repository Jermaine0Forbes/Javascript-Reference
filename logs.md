### Today I'm 
- trying to figure out how to use gulp-concat 
- and see if I can concatenate certain files, but leave others alone 

So the `gulp-tslint` is supposed to search through your ts files and see if there are any errors 
and possibly clean them up 

I also noticed that gulp takes a long time compile the ts files, approximately 3 seconds, that is three seconds too long 

Other than that, I am sort of fine with gulp is doing, I have not complete my objectives though

I'm just playing around with the typescript options. You can technically make a concatenation of typescript 
files without downloading gulp-concat, but I need to practice some more with it to get the hang of things.
